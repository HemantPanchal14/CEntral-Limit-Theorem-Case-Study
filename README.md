# The Central Limit Theorem ( CLT ) 
It says that with a large sample size, " SAMPLE MEAN" are normally distributed.
A sample mean is the average of a random subset of a larger group
The distribution of the " SAMPLE MEAN"
1) WILL be NORMAL when the distribution of data in the population is NORMAL
2) WILL be approximately normal even if the distribution of data in the population is not normal,If the sample size is " FAIRLY LARGE"

Here,Sample size make the Difference
